Test case for AND combination of events but a timeout at the same time.
Has been implemented in r233 but never been tested at that time.

Test case for user interrupts. They have never been tested when comitted
in r227.

Implementation of waitForEventsUntillTime:
  Done as part of waitForEvent.
Now we have the situation that rtos_suspendTaskTillTime is a code copy of
most of rtos_waitForEvent and its functionality actually is a subset of
the functionality of rtos_waitForEvent. It could therefore become a macro
calling rtos_waitForEvent.
  Consider to do: Advantage is more straight forward implementation,
drawback is somewhat less performant implementation of relevant use case
of regular tasks. However, replacing suspendTaskTillTime by waitForEvent
has already been a step in the same direction.
  CAUTION: The documentation of rtos_suspendTaskTillTime is surely worth
it.

Implement EnterLeaveCriticalSection (cli/sei and only TIMER2)
        , get/setRoundRobin?
